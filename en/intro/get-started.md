## ℹ About

Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.

## ⬆️ Advantages

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.

- No hidden control flow.
- No hidden memory allocations.
- No preprocessor, no macros.

A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code execution and lazy evaluation.

- Call any function at compile-time.
- Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.
- Comptime emulates the target architecture.

Incrementally improve your C/C++/Zig codebase.

- Use Zig as a zero-dependency, drop-in C/C++ compiler that supports cross-compilation out-of-the-box.
- Leverage zig build to create a consistent development environment across all platforms.
- Add a Zig compilation unit to C/C++ projects; cross-language LTO is enabled by default.
